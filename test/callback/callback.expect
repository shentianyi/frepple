Create the model with callbacks:
  Calendar 'test' receives signal ADD
  Item 'end item' receives signal ADD
  OperationFixedTime 'make end item' receives signal ADD
  Operation 'make end item' receives signal ADD
  Calendar 'Capacity' receives signal ADD
  OperationFixedTime 'delivery end item' receives signal ADD
  Operation 'delivery end item' receives signal ADD
  Demand 'order 1' receives signal ADD
Plan the model:
Erase the model:
  OperationFixedTime 'delivery end item' receives signal REMOVE
  Operation 'delivery end item' receives signal REMOVE
  OperationFixedTime 'make end item' receives signal REMOVE
  Operation 'make end item' receives signal REMOVE
  Demand 'order 1' receives signal REMOVE
  BufferDefault 'end item @ loc' receives signal REMOVE
  Buffer 'end item @ loc' receives signal REMOVE
  Calendar 'Capacity' receives signal REMOVE
  Calendar 'test' receives signal REMOVE
  Item 'end item' receives signal REMOVE
Recreate the model without callbacks:
