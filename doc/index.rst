frePPLe |release| documentation
===============================


To **get started** we suggest the following introduction trail:

#. | :doc:`Install the software <installation-guide/windows-installer>` 
     or `register for a free trial on our cloud  <https://register.frepple.com/accounts/register/>`_
   | The easiest start to learn frePPLe is to use an online trial
     environment on our cloud servers.
   | Installing it locally on a Windows machine is also easy. An
     all-in-one installer installs the planning engine, PostgreSQL
     database and the user interface web server.

#. | :doc:`Follow the guided tour <user-guide/user-interface/guided-tour>`
   | The application has an integrated guided tour. It interactively walks
     you through the main screens in less than 10 minutes.

#. | :doc:`Build your own model<user-guide/modeling-wizard/index>`
   | The application has an integrated wizard that will guide you through
     building your first model step by step.

#. | Visit the `community forum <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/frepple-users>`_.
   | You're invited to post questions, suggestions and issues to the group.
