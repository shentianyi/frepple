========================
Supply Path / Where Used
========================

This report follows the bill of material to show how a buffer is being
replenished. When called for a resource, it shows the operations using the
resource and their supply path.

The report canâ€™t be called directly from the main menu, but it is accessed
from the context menus.

The report can follow the material flows in both directions:

* | The **supply path** report follows how material is produced or replenished.
  | It shows the path from end item upstream towards all raw materials required
    for the end item.

* | The **where-used** report follows how material is being consumed.
  | It shows the path from raw material downstream towards all end items using
    the material.
