=============
Demand report
=============

This report shows per item and per time bucket the demand quantity, the supplied quantity and the backlog.

A drilldown report is also available to show the detailed data as a list.

If the report is opened for a single item a graph is displayed.

| Given the row definitions, the following equations apply:
|   **total demand = net forecast + orders**
|   **backlog = backlog of previous bucket + total demand â€“ total supply**
