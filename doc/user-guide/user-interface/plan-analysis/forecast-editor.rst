The panel is split in two areas:

- | The top section of the screen allows to select a
    specific forecast.
  | The buttons to the right let you choose if you want to see in quantity
    or in value. You can also select your time buckets (ie weeks, months, quarters or years).
  | The order of the top panels define the hierarchy of the selection.
    There is a dropdown menu where you can choose this order.
  | When you click on a line in a panel this line will be selected and expand if there
    are other records inside it (or collapse if it is already expanded), then the panels
    to the right will reset their selections.

  | The Attributes tab will present addicional information about the current selections of
    the top panels.
  | The Forecast tab displays the graphic of the selected forecast, a table where forecasts can be tunned (fields are
    described bellow), and a dropdown where the forecast method can be selected.
    After changes are made the Recalculate button will be active. By pressing recalculate a simulation of the forecast will be performed.
    Only after pressing Save will the changes be stored on the database.

    or Item-Location.

The table in the forecast tab is for forecast tunning. Adjustments can be made and will have an immediate impact on the graph above the table.

Here is a description of the fields on the forecast table:

==================== ==============================================================================
Field                Description
==================== ==============================================================================

                     orders.

Orders Adjustment    | Manual adjustment added to the total order quantity.
                     | This adjustment can be applicable for a) removing exceptional demand
                       outliers from the demand history, or b) intializing the forecast for a new
                       product with the demand history of a similar, existing product.
                     | The forecast calculations add the order adjustment and the total orders
                       as the demand history input for the calculation.
Forecast Baseline    Statistical forecast generated by the system.
Forecast Override    | Manual adjustment of the forecast.
                     | If a value is entered in this row, it completely replaces the baseline
                       forecast proposed by the system.
Forecast Total       Sum of the baseline forecast and the forecast adjustment.
