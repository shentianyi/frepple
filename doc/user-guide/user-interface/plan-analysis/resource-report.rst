Resource report
===============

This report shows the loading of the resources.

If the report is opened for a single resource a load graph is displayed.

The report shows the plan result in size*time.
E.g. a resource has size 1 and we are looking at a weekly bucket: available = 7
E.g. a resource has size 3 and we are looking at a weekly bucket: available = 21
The parameter **loading_time_units** defines the time units. Acceptable values are hours, days and weeks.
