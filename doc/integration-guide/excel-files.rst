For small models and prototype models the most convenenient way
of integrating the data will be to work with excel workbooks.

* | Individual data tables can be exported and imported directly
    from the user interface. 
  | See :doc:`/user-guide/user-interface/getting-around/importing-data`
    and :doc:`/user-guide/user-interface/getting-around/exporting-data`.
  
* | Multiple data tables can be exported and imported in single workbook.
    The workbook contains a seperate sheet for each table.
  | See :doc:`/user-guide/user-interface/execute`.
