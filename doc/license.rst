The frePPLe software has dual licensing, which means:

* | You can use the **Community Edition** software completely free under the
    `GNU Affero General Public License <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>`_.
  | In short, the AGPL license is a strong copyleft license. You are allowed
    to copy, use and modify the source code as long as any derived product
    remains  AGPL-compatible open source : 'what is open source must remain
    open source'.
  | You can thus not make a proprietary commercial product using frePPLe.
  | This also applies to users who interact with frePPLe over a network: they
    must be able receive the source code.

* | The frePPLe **Enterprise Edition** is distributed under a proprietary
    commercial license.
  | The source code of the extensions is not redistributed.

* | You can also purchase a **commercial OEM license** from frePPLe bvba if
    you do not wish to be bound by the terms of the AGPL.
  | With this license you have the right to create frePPle-based products and
    services that can remain proprietary and protected.
